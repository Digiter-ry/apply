# Apply ‚Äì Modular AI-Powered Service Suite

**Apply** is a modular digital service developed under the **Kanavana** brand in collaboration with **Digiter ry**.  
Its purpose is to provide practical, AI-powered tools that support everyday application and information processes for both individuals and organizations.

## üå± Project Background

This development is part of a broader effort to build open, inclusive and scalable digital services.  
Apply is currently included in several funding applications:

- **AID4SME Open Call 1** (Kanavana)  
- **NLnet Foundation** grant (Kanavana)  
- **AMIF (Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund)** consortium proposal (Digiter ry)  
- **Kone Foundation** application (Digiter ry)

Both Kanavana and Digiter ry share the same core development path at this stage.  
Kanavana focuses on the **commercial and productization side**, while Digiter ry leads the **nonprofit and open development track**.  
The codebase is intentionally open and transparent to support both.
